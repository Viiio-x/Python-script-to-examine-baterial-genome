# Python-script-to-examine-baterial-genome

This project is a final course project of Practical computing for Biological Sciences.

In this Python project, we imported Biopython to implement an examination of a specific bacteria genome: Escherichia coli JE86-ST05 DNA. With scanning DNA strands and translation of open reading frames, the script returns the potential expressed protein sequence. Then we also calculated predicted molecular mass and blast 5 protein coding sequences at NCBI with a return of most similar hits.
